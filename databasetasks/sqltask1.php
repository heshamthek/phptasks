<!-- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.
SQL is used for the following:

Modifying database table and index structures.
Adding, updating and deleting rows of data.
Retrieving subsets of information from within relational database management systems (RDBMSes). This information can be used for transaction processing, analytics applications and other applications that require communicating with a relational database.
